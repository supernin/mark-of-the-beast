*/QRcode generator to be able to comprehend through the image a machine learning as follows. TheQR code being scanned to store data backlogs for later suggestions in order to be taught instead of parrot-incubation. The program will need to have simulated the scenario then have an actual device capable of completing the order. Starting off with finding allowable source in order to find a method to be scanned input for data storage & again for output suggestions from/&for a program. The program will no doubt learn, but how is a method unheard except in the human sense of the ability to write in commands. Not the case here! The simulation will need better progress rather than the argument "then" being a step backwards in time and machine comprehension. So this part being a complete reorder of QRcode scanning and the research of QRcode scanning but wont matter the source code until a device is then generated{made} to accept QRcodes scanned to be able to understand voiced commands alone(as in the QRcodes that are scanned be the sole provider of the machine comprehension). Also to add that the spoken words will be contained as suggestions instead of whole phrases which would again complete the parrot-incubation in which this is not and plans not to have the parrot format. The thoughts of this are strong and will have crazy and unreal thought process "blocks" so may the force be with you.*/
